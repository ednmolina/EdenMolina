# About Me
I graduated in 2018 from the Univeristy of California, Los Angeles with a degree in Physics. I have had experience workin with large data sets, image processing, and machine learning. Outside of school I am interested in photography and interesting places to eat food. Currently I am working as a Data Science intern at a small start up called Fulcrum Labs.

# Experience
### NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) I worked under Jason Rhodes and Hironao Miyatake to investigate assembly bias as a function of brightest clustry galaxy (BCG) ellipticity.  The clustering of dark matter halos is enhaced by the underlying dark matter dsitribution that we do not see, this phenomena is called bias. It has been theoretically shown that bias can depend on other halo properties other than mass, this is known as assembly bias.

I used data 8,648 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) red-sequence DR8 Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolaion (redMaPPer) galaxy clusters. I write Python scripts to extract statitics from the catalog of galaxies and galaxy clusters. After calculating the weak lensing and clustering signals from the data it was found that there was not evidence of assembly bias correlated with BCG ellipticity.

More details about the project can be found in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKP9kqtFVC72Ax0UybrYBXIOzsmCFdqK/view?usp=sharing) report I wrote summarizeing what I did that summer.

### Fulcrum Labs

I am currently a Data Science intern for Fulcrum Labs, a start up developing an adaptive learning platform. During my first quarter at the company I devised a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that will determine if a student's response to a question is related to a body of text they were to read. Furthermore, I prototyped an algorithm that will assign a performace score to a student given a report from an instructor about a student's behavior in class. This performance score and be augmented by how well they complete courses on the platform. 

# Research
### UCLA Physics and Astronomy Lensed Quasar

Under Professor Tommaso Treu, his graduate students, and his post-docs we worked on a prject that cronicled five years of follow up and confirmation lensed quasars through Keck-NIRC2, a camera at Keck Observatory. I learned how to analyze images with Python and how to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

I used an MCMC to estimate the amount of light, flux, of galaxies and quasars we objected in the images by assuming the distribution of light emmited by the objects followed a Gaussian Distribution.
