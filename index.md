# About Me
I graduated in 2018 from the Univeristy of California, Los Angeles with a degree in Physics. I have had experience workin with large data sets, image processing, and machine learning. Outside of school I am interested in photography and interesting places to eat food. Currently I am working as a Data Science intern at a small start up called Fulcrum Labs.

# Internships
### NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) I worked under Jason Rhodes and Hironao Miyatake to investigate assembly bias as a function of brightest clustry galaxy (BCG) ellipticity.  The clustering of dark matter halos is enhaced by the underlying dark matter dsitribution that we do not see, this phenomena is called bias. It has been theoretically shown that bias can depend on other halo properties other than mass, this is known as assembly bias.

I used data 8,648 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) red-sequence DR8 Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolaion (redMaPPer) galaxy clusters. I write Python scripts to extract statitics from the catalog of galaxies and galaxy clusters. After calculating the weak lensing and clustering signals from the data it was found that there was not evidence of assembly bias correlated with BCG ellipticity.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

### Header 2

var fun = function lang(l) {

  return true;

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
